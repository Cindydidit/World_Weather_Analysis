# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

PlanMyTrip is a top travel technology company which specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack, the head of analysis for the user interface team, has asked me to help him collect and present for PlanMyTrip’s search page. This will ameliorate the platform and provide real-time suggestions for the customers’ ideal hotels. After collecting and analyzing weather data across cities throughout the world, I incorporated the data for customers’ usage via PlanMyTrip’s search page. Our customers will use this collected data and filter though the presented recommendations to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. based on our clients’ weather preferences.
